COMPLETE WEBSITE REBRANDING & MIGRATION PROMPT
================================================

I need to completely rebrand and migrate this website to a new brand and domain. Here are my details:

NEW DOMAIN: [YOUR_NEW_DOMAIN] (e.g., mtolyn.store)
NEW BRAND NAME: [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME] (e.g., Mitolyn)

IMPORTANT: Brand Name Capitalization Rules
- Capitalize at the START of sentences: "Mitolyn delivers..."
- Lowercase in the MIDDLE of sentences: "...with Mitolyn's formula..."
- Lowercase in alt text, attributes, and technical references
- Always capitalize in titles and headings

Please perform the following comprehensive changes:

1. DOMAIN REPLACEMENT:
   - Find and replace ALL occurrences of "mtolyn-us.us" or "mtolyn-us.com" with "[YOUR_NEW_DOMAIN]" (without https://)
   - Update in: layout.tsx, sitemap.ts, robots.ts, StructuredData.tsx, and all page.tsx files
   - Update all canonical URLs
   - Update sitemap baseUrl
   - Update robots.txt sitemap URL

2. BRAND NAME REPLACEMENT:
   - Find and replace ALL occurrences of "Mitolyn" (case-sensitive) with "[YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME]"
   - IMPORTANT: Capitalize at sentence starts, lowercase in middle of sentences
   - Update in ALL component files, page files, and metadata
   - Ensure consistent branding throughout
   - Fix capitalization: Use sed commands or manual fixes:
     * After periods: ". mitolyn" → ". Mitolyn"
     * After exclamation: "! mitolyn" → "! Mitolyn"
     * After question marks: "? mitolyn" → "? Mitolyn"
     * At paragraph starts: "mitolyn" → "Mitolyn"

3. SEO UNIQUENESS:
   - Update title: Change "Mitolyn™ Official | Metabolism Booster & Fat Burner" to "[YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME]™ Official | [Unique Value Proposition]" with different wording
   - Keep title under 60 characters
   - Rewrite meta description: Keep same intent but use 30-40% different wording
   - Keep description under 160 characters
   - Update all keywords to include [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME] and remove old brand references
   - Update all page metadata (Privacy, Terms, etc.) with unique descriptions

4. CONTENT REWRITING (Make Unique):
   - Hero Section: Rewrite main description with different sentence structure, keep same information
   - WhatIsMitolyn: Rewrite all paragraphs starting with [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME], use synonyms
   - HowItWorks: Rewrite all bullet points with different phrasing
   - Benefits: Rewrite all benefit descriptions with different adjectives
   - Ingredients: Keep ingredients same but rewrite descriptions uniquely
   - Reviews: Update customer names/locations, rewrite review text, slightly change weight numbers
   - FAQ: Rewrite all Q&A with different wording, same topics
   - All Policy Pages: Rewrite content uniquely while maintaining legal accuracy

5. DESIGN DIFFERENTIATION:

9. REMOVE OLD TRACES:
   - Search and remove any remaining old brand references
   - Remove old domain references
   - Remove old brand-specific paths
   - Clean up any old analytics/verification codes

10. FINAL VERIFICATION:
    - Ensure sitemap.xml uses new domain

    - Verify all canonical URLs updated
    - Test all pages load correctly
    - Verify no old brand traces remain
    - Check capitalization: All sentence starts should have capitalized brand name

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Don't just find-replace content - actually REWRITE sentences to avoid duplicate content
- Make SEO descriptions 30-40% different while keeping same intent
- Keep title under 60 characters, description under 160 characters
- Change design colors to differentiate visually
- Ensure all content starts with [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME] (capitalized) where applicable
- Keep legal pages accurate but uniquely worded
- Fix capitalization: Brand name should be capitalized at sentence starts

CAPITALIZATION FIXES (Use these commands or manual fixes):
- sed -i '' 's/\. mitolyn/. Mitolyn/g' src/app/**/*.tsx
- sed -i '' 's/! mitolyn/! Mitolyn/g' src/app/**/*.tsx
- sed -i '' 's/? mitolyn/? Mitolyn/g' src/app/**/*.tsx
- Fix paragraph starts manually in components

Please complete all steps systematically and verify each change.
