COMPLETE WEBSITE REBRANDING & MIGRATION PROMPT
================================================

I need to completely rebrand and migrate this website to a new brand and domain. Here are my details:

NEW DOMAIN: [YOUR_NEW_DOMAIN] (e.g., https://example-product.com)
NEW BRAND NAME: [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME] (e.g., MetaboSlim)

Please perform the following comprehensive changes:

1. DOMAIN REPLACEMENT:
   - Find and replace ALL occurrences of "mtolyn-us.us" or "mtolyn-us.com" with "[YOUR_NEW_DOMAIN]" (without https://)
   - Update in: layout.tsx, sitemap.ts, robots.ts, StructuredData.tsx, and all page.tsx files
   - Update all canonical URLs
   - Update sitemap baseUrl
   - Update robots.txt sitemap URL

2. BRAND NAME REPLACEMENT:
   - Find and replace ALL occurrences of "Mitolyn" (case-sensitive) with "[YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME]"
   - Update in ALL component files, page files, and metadata
   - Ensure consistent branding throughout

3. SEO UNIQUENESS:
   - Update title: Change "Mitolyn™ Official | Metabolism Booster & Fat Burner" to "[YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME]™ Official | [Unique Value Proposition]" with different wording
   - Rewrite meta description: Keep same intent but use 30-40% different wording
   - Update all keywords to include [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME] and remove "mitolyn"
   - Update all page metadata (Privacy, Terms, etc.) with unique descriptions

4. CONTENT REWRITING (Make Unique):
   - Hero Section: Rewrite main description with different sentence structure, keep same information
   - WhatIsMitolyn: Rewrite all paragraphs starting with [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME], use synonyms
   - HowItWorks: Rewrite all bullet points with different phrasing
   - Benefits: Rewrite all benefit descriptions with different adjectives
   - Ingredients: Keep ingredients same but rewrite descriptions uniquely
   - Reviews: Update customer names/locations, rewrite review text, slightly change weight numbers
   - FAQ: Rewrite all Q&A with different wording, same topics
   - All Policy Pages: Rewrite content uniquely while maintaining legal accuracy

5. DESIGN DIFFERENTIATION:
   - Hero Background: Change from blue gradient to different colors (e.g., purple, teal, or different blue shades)
   - Header/Navbar: Change gradient colors
   - Section Backgrounds: Adjust colors (Reviews section, etc.)
   - Typography: Slightly adjust font sizes/weights
   - Spacing: Adjust padding/margins slightly

6. IMAGES & ASSETS:
   - Update all image URLs to new brand folder/paths
   - Update all alt text to use [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME]
   - Update logo references in Header
   - Update favicon URL in layout.tsx

7. STRUCTURED DATA:
   - Update baseUrl in StructuredData.tsx to [YOUR_NEW_DOMAIN]
   - Update organization name to "[YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME] Official"
   - Update logo URL
   - Update product name in schema
   - Update all brand references

8. VERIFICATION CODES:
   - Remove old Bing verification: "DF238DB2B8BB655EFD6CF96236274D79"
   - Add new Bing verification code for new domain (I'll provide it)
   - Update Google Analytics ID if present
   - Update any other platform verification codes

9. REMOVE OLD TRACES:
   - Search and remove any remaining "Mitolyn" references
   - Remove old domain references
   - Remove old brand-specific paths
   - Clean up any old analytics/verification codes

10. FINAL VERIFICATION:
    - Ensure sitemap.xml uses new domain
    - Ensure robots.txt uses new domain
    - Verify all canonical URLs updated
    - Test all pages load correctly
    - Verify no old brand traces remain

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Don't just find-replace content - actually REWRITE sentences to avoid duplicate content
- Make SEO descriptions 30-40% different while keeping same intent
- Change design colors to differentiate visually
- Ensure all content starts with [YOUR_NEW_BRAND_NAME] where applicable
- Keep legal pages accurate but uniquely worded

Please complete all steps systematically and verify each change.
